# playground
A framework-agnostic component playground and library designed to be seamlessly integrated into any front-end application. This monorepo demonstrates a modular architecture for creating a reusable, in-app component showcase.

## Key Features
* Pluggable Architecture: A core, framework-agnostic engine that can be embededded as a route or page within an existing React, Vue, or Angular applications.
* Universal Prop Editor: Features a real-time prop editor that uses immutable.js Records to provide a type-safe and predictable way to manage component state across frameworks.
* Enhanced DX: Empowers a developer to explore and test their components interactively without leaving their development environment.

This project serves as a showcase of advanced front-end architecture, library design, and micro-frontend patterns.
